The Shining Light company has developed a new type of light bulb which it recently
tested. 1,000 bulbs were switched on and observed until they failed, or until 500
hours had elapsed. For each bulb that failed, the duration in hours until failure was
noted. Due to an earth tremor after 200 hours, 200 bulbs shattered and had to be
removed from the test before failure.
The results showed that \\10 bulbs failed after 50 hours,\\ 20 bulbs failed after 100 hours,\\
50 bulbs failed after 250 hours, \\300 bulbs failed after 400 hours \\ 50 bulbs failed
after 450 hours.

q. Calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function, $S(t)$, for the light
bulbs in the test.
b.  Sketch the Kaplan-Meier estimate calculated in part (a).
c. Estimate the probability that a bulb will not have failed after each of the
following durations: 300 hours, 400 hours and 600 hours. If it is not possible
to obtain an estimate for any of the durations without additional assumptions,
explain why.

Survival Analysis Kaplan Meier Insects CT4 2005 April B5.mp4




\noindent A study of the mortality of 12 laboratory-bred insects was undertaken. The insects
were observed from birth until either they died or the period of study ended, at which
point those insects still alive were treated as censored.\\
\\
\noindent The following table shows the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function, based
on data from the 12 insects.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
\phantom{spa} t (weeks) \phantom{spa}  & \phantom{spa} S(t) \phantom{spa} \\ \hline \hline
$0 \leq t < 1$ & 1.0000 \\ \hline
$1 \leq  t < 3$ & 0.9167\\ \hline
$3 \leq t < 6$ & 0.7130\\ \hline
$ t \geq  6$ & 0.4278\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  Calculate the number of insects dying at durations 3 and 6 weeks. 
    \item Calculate the number of insects whose history was censored.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{framed}
\noindent The estimator of the survival function ${\displaystyle S(t)}$ (the probability that life is longer than ${\displaystyle t}$) is given by:

\[{\displaystyle {\widehat {S}}(t)=\prod \limits _{i:\ t_{i}\leq t}\left(1-{\frac {d_{i}}{n_{i}}}\right) =\prod \limits _{i:\ t_{i}\leq t}\left(1-\lambda_i \right),} \]

\noindent with ${\displaystyle t_{i}}$ a time when at least one event happened, $d_i$ the number of events (e.g., deaths) that happened at time $ {\displaystyle t_{i}}$, and 
${\displaystyle n_{i}}$ the individuals known to have survived (have not yet had an event or been censored) up to time ${\displaystyle t_{i}}$. 
\end{framed}
