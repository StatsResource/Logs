Video 200 - Uniform Distribution

The weights to salads taken by customers at a self-service salad bare found to be uniformly distributed between 250g and 450g

<h5> Exercises </h5> 
a. Write down the probability density function for this distribution.
b. Find the probability that a customer will take a salad weighing more than 400g.
c. Find the probability that a customer will take a salad weighing between 320g and 400g.
d. What are the mean and standard deviations of the salad weights taken by customers.

 Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are events from a sample space such that
 $P(A) = 0.65$ and $P(B) =0.45$ and $P(A\cap B) = 0.32$

 <h5> Exercises </h5> 
a. Find $P(B^{c})$.
b. Find $P(B|A)$.
c. Find $P(A \;\cup\;B)$.
d. Find $P(A^{c} \;\cup\;B^{c})$.

 Harmonic Mean
 
 \[ H = \frac{n}{ \frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \ldots \frac{1}{x_n} } \]

* Example 1  - Find the harmonic mean of ${7,9\}$.
* Example 2  - Find the harmonic mean of ${7,9,3\}$.

One of the questions on a business magainzes subscribers only study was:

"In the past 12 months, when travelling for business, what types of airline tickets did you purchase most often?"

The data obtained are show in the table below
  
| | | Domestic Flight | International Flight| |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| | First Class | 65 | 55 ||
| |Business Class / Executive | 140 | 100||
| | Economy |520|120||  

<h5> Exercises </h5> 
* Using a 5% significance level, test for the independence of type of flight and type of ticket. What is your conclusion?

Probability - Independent Events
Suppose that A and B are two independent events with P(A), the probability that A occurs, equal to 0.4, and P(B), the probability that B occurs, equal to 0.5.
You may assume that A and B are independent events.

<h5> Exercises </h5> 
a. Calculate $P(A \cap B)$, the probability of both A and B occuring (i.e. simultaneously).
b. Calculate $P(A \cup B)$, the probability of either A and B (or both) occuring.
